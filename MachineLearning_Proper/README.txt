Due to the nature of the course alot of the basic functions were prewritten for
us so that we could focus upon the specifics, as such alot of the code needs 
support code - that i wont put up because its not mine.

Also alot of the code is an absolute mess due to the weekly deadlines, meaning
generally it was throwaway code that i didnt expect to need to come back to.
